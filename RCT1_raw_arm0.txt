-------------- PATIENT ID 2 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On September 11th, 2021, I conducted a clinic visit with Patient ID 2, a 64-year-old female who has been diagnosed with asthma, diabetes, and epilepsy. The patient has experienced 17 seizures over the past two months, which is concerning and warrants further evaluation.

During the examination, I performed a complete neurological assessment to evaluate the patient's condition. Her vital signs were within normal limits, with a temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and a heart rate of 72 beats per minute. The patient's mental status was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. She was able to communicate effectively and respond appropriately to questions.

The neurological examination revealed no significant abnormalities, with normal strength, sensation, and reflexes in all four limbs. However, the patient did exhibit a mild tremor in her hands, which is consistent with her history of epilepsy. Additionally, I noticed a slight weakness in the patient's right hand, which may be related to her diabetes or another underlying condition.

Based on the patient's medical history and current symptoms, I have decided to enroll her in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an investigational drug for epilepsy. The patient will be taking this medication for three months, and I will closely monitor her seizure activity and overall health during this time. No changes will be made to the patient's current medications, other than adding the investigational drug, to minimize any potential risks or interactions. I will follow up with the patient in three months to assess her response to the medication and make any necessary adjustments to her treatment plan.

Assessment and Plan:

Based on the patient's history of recurrent seizures and his current enrollment in an RCT evaluating an investigational drug for epilepsy, it is essential to monitor his seizure activity closely. The patient will continue taking his current medications, with the addition of the investigational drug for a 3-month period. The patient will be seen every 2 weeks for a follow-up visit to assess his seizure activity and monitor his response to the investigational drug.

The patient's history of alcoholism and bipolar disorder, along with his current seizure activity, suggest that he may be at risk for developing depression or anxiety. Therefore, it is essential to closely monitor his mental status and address any changes in his mood or cognitive function promptly.

The patient's knee and lower back pain should also be addressed, as this may be affecting his quality of life and potentially contributing to his seizure activity.

Patient ID: 8

Chief Complaint:
The patient presents with a history of autism, hypothyroidism, and parietal lobe epilepsy. He has been experiencing increased seizure activity over the past two months, with 3.0 seizures occurring during this time frame. The patient is currently enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating an innovative treatment for his epilepsy.

Past Medical History:
Autism diagnosed at age 3
Hypothyroidism diagnosed at age 10
Parietal lobe epilepsy diagnosed at age 18

Family History:
No history of neurological disorders in immediate family members

Social History:
The patient is a 42-year-old male who is currently unemployed. He lives with his parents and has difficulty communicating with others due to his autism spectrum disorder (ASD). He is non-verbal and uses a communication device to express himself. The patient's cognitive function is mildly impaired, and he has difficulty with independent living skills.

Review of Systems:
The patient denies any recent changes in his seizure activity or medications. He reports no new symptoms or complaints.

Neurological Examination:

* Mental Status: The patient is alert and cooperative, but his cognitive function is mildly impaired. He is able to communicate using a communication device.
* Cranial Nerves: The patient demonstrates gross motor weakness on the right side of his body due to the parietal lobe epilepsy. There is no evidence of cranial nerve deficits.
* Sensory Examination: The patient has decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick on the right side of his body, consistent with the previous diagnosis of parietal lobe epilepsy.
* Motor Examination: The patient demonstrates gross motor weakness on the right side of his body, including a lack of spontaneous movements and difficulty with purposeful movements. He is able to perform purposeful movements with assistance.
* Reflexes: The patient has areflexia on the right side of his body.
* Gait Examination: The patient demonstrates an unsteady gait, with a wide base of support and a tendency to stumble.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's increased seizure activity over the past two months is concerning, especially given his history of parietal lobe epilepsy. The patient's current medication regimen, which includes levetiracetam and valproic acid, will be maintained for the time being. However, we will add the investigational drug being studied in the RCT to the patient's regimen for a period of three months to assess its efficacy in reducing seizure activity. The patient will be closely monitored for any changes in his seizure activity or medication side effects.

The patient's cognitive function is mildly impaired, and he has difficulty with independent living skills. Therefore, the patient will continue to receive ongoing support from his family and caregivers. The patient will also participate in regular therapy sessions to improve his communication skills and independence.

Future Follow-Up:
The patient will be followed up in one month to assess the efficacy of the investigational drug and monitor for any changes in his seizure activity or medication side effects.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, including blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, heart rate 70 beats per minute, and temperature 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's neurological examination reveals no significant abnormalities, including normal motor function, sensory function, and reflexes.

Comprehensive Neurologic Exam:

The patient undergoes a comprehensive neurologic examination, including assessment of her cognitive function, mood, and behavior. The patient scores 28/30 on the Mental Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ), indicating minimal impairment in her cognitive and emotional functioning. Her speech is clear and concise, with no apparent language deficits. The patient's memory and attention span are within normal limits, and she demonstrates intact executive function abilities.

Labs:

The patient's recent laboratory results include:

1. Complete Blood Count (CBC): Within normal limits
2. Serum electrolytes: Within normal limits
3. Liver function tests (LFTs): Within normal limits
4. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): 4.25 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L)

Imaging:

The patient's recent imaging results include:

1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain: No significant abnormalities noted, including no evidence of structural brain injury or lesions.
2. Electroencephalogram (EEG): No significant abnormalities noted, including no evidence of seizure activity outside of clinical settings.

Assessment:

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory results, and imaging studies, we have performed a comprehensive assessment of her neurological status. The patient's recent increase in seizure activity is concerning and may be related to her participation in the RCT. However, given the lack of any significant changes in her medical history, medications, or lifestyle, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific cause for the increased seizures. Further investigation and monitoring are necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of the investigational drug.

Plan:

1. Continue the patient's current medication regimen, including levetiracetam (Keppra) 500mg QID, lamotrigine (Lamictal) 200mg QHS, and investigational drug for epilepsy (RCT medication) 250mg BID for 3 months.
2. Increase the patient's frequency of follow-up visits to every two weeks to monitor her seizure activity and adjust her medications as needed.
3. Encourage the patient to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, avoid alcohol and drugs, and practice stress-reducing techniques such as yoga and meditation.
4. Consider adding an additional medication or modifying the current regimen if the patient's seizure activity does not improve with continued monitoring and adjustments.

-------------- PATIENT ID 25 -- VISIT 2 -----------

On December 19th, 2022, I conducted a routine follow-up visit with Patient ID 25, a 67-year-old male participating in a randomized controlled trial. The patient has a history of seasonal allergies, hypertension, diabetes, and parietal lobe epilepsy. Over the past three months, the patient has been administered the investigational drug ID X13737 for their epilepsy.

During this visit, the patient reported experiencing 23.0 seizures since initiating treatment with ID X13737. The patient also complained of dizziness and somnolence. These adverse effects have been consistent throughout the trial period. In light of these findings, it has been decided to discontinue the investigational drug now that the study is complete.

Upon conducting a comprehensive neurological examination, I observed no significant changes in the patient's neurological status since the last visit. The patient's speech, language, and cognitive functions were all intact, with no evidence of any seizure activity or abnormal movements. However, the patient did exhibit some dizziness and reported feeling somnolent, which may be related to the discontinuation of the investigational drug.

In conclusion, this visit marked the end of Patient ID 25's participation in the randomized controlled trial for the investigational drug ID X13737. The patient experienced a significant number of seizures during the trial period, and adverse effects such as dizziness and somnolence were also reported. However, there were no significant changes in the patient's neurological status, and all necessary steps have been taken to ensure a safe and orderly discontinuation of the drug.

Assessment:

The patient presents with a history of recent-onset seizures and back pain while on investigational drug ID X13737 for epilepsy. The patient's neurological examination and laboratory results are unremarkable, except for moderate reflexes bilaterally. Given the recent onset of seizures and back pain, as well as the patient's history of seasonal allergies, temporal lobe epilepsy, depression, and schizophrenia, it is likely that these symptoms are related to the investigational drug. The patient's anxiety and depression symptoms have worsened since starting the investigational drug, which may also be contributing to the seizures and back pain.

Plan:

1. Discontinue the investigational drug ID X13737 due to adverse effects.
2. Increase the dosage of Levetiracetam (Keppra) to 2500mg orally BID for seizure control.
3. Add Valproic acid (Depakote) 500mg orally BID for seizure control.
4. Refer the patient to physical therapy for back pain management.

On June 28, 2021, I conducted a routine follow-up visit with Patient ID 40, a 74-year-old female who has been participating in a randomized controlled trial for the investigational drug ID X13737 for her epilepsy. Over the past three months, the patient has been taking the medication and has reported no symptoms. However, she has experienced 20.0 seizures during this time period.

Upon examination, the patient's neurological status was found to be unchanged since her last visit. Her speech, language, and cognitive functions were all within normal limits. There was no evidence of weakness, numbness, or paresthesias in her extremities. Her reflexes were appropriate for her age and there was no signs of ataxia or dysmetria.

The patient's past medical history includes a history of parietal lobe epilepsy, which has been well-controlled with current medications. There have been no changes in her medication regimen over the past three months. The patient reported no new symptoms or concerns since her last visit.

Given that the randomized controlled trial is now complete, it has been decided to discontinue the investigational drug ID X13737. The patient will be transitioned back to her previous medication regimen and will be monitored closely for any changes in her seizure activity or other symptoms. Her next follow-up visit is scheduled for three months from now, at which time we will reassess her condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed.

On February 5th, 2023, I had the pleasure of conducting visit #1 with Patient ID 45, a 96-year-old male who has been graciously participating in our randomized controlled trial. As part of this study, we are closely monitoring his health and any changes that may occur due to the investigational drug being administered for the treatment of his generalized epilepsy.

During this initial visit, I was pleased to note that Patient ID 45 appears in excellent spirits and is currently not experiencing any adverse effects from the medication. His previous history of ADHD, seasonal allergies, anxiety, and generalized epilepsy remains unchanged, and he has reported a total of 12 seizures over the past two months. We will continue to closely monitor his condition and adjust the dosage of the investigational drug as needed to ensure optimal efficacy while minimizing potential side effects.

In addition to reviewing Patient ID 45's medical history, I also conducted a comprehensive neurological examination. This included assessing his cognitive function, motor skills, balance and coordination, reflexes, and sensory perception. All of these areas were found to be within normal limits for a patient of his age and medical history. Furthermore, there were no notable changes in his overall condition since the last time he was evaluated.

I am confident that with the continued administration of the investigational drug, Patient ID 45 will experience improved seizure control and an enhancement in his overall quality of life. I look forward to monitoring his progress closely over the next several months and adjusting his treatment plan as needed to ensure the best possible outcome for this remarkable individual.

Visit #2, July 15th, 2022

Patient ID 46, a 69-year-old female, presented for her second visit in the randomized controlled trial. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, diabetes, and occipital lobe epilepsy. Over the past three months, the patient has been administered the investigational drug ID X13737 for the treatment of her epilepsy.

During this visit, the patient reported a significant reduction in seizure activity, with only 14.0 seizures experienced since the initiation of the study. This is a marked improvement from the patient's previous baseline of approximately 20-25 seizures per month. The patient did not report any adverse symptoms or side effects associated with the investigational drug.

A complete neurological examination was performed, and the results were unremarkable. The patient's cognitive function and memory were intact, and there was no evidence of altered mental status or confusion. The patient's speech was clear and concise, and her language skills were normal. No abnormalities were detected in the patient's sensory examination, including vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell.

On December 2nd, 2022, I conducted a follow-up visit with Patient ID 47, a 58-year-old female who has been participating in a randomized controlled trial for the investigational drug ID X13737 for her parietal lobe epilepsy. Over the past three months, the patient has taken the medication and has reported experiencing 9.0 seizures during this time period. Additionally, the patient has reported feeling dizzy.

Upon conducting a complete neurological examination, I noted that the patient's cognitive function and memory appear to be normal. Her speech is clear and she is able to understand and respond to commands. There are no signs of weakness or paralysis on the right side of her body, and her sensation and reflexes are intact. However, the patient does report some dizziness and lightheadedness, which may be related to the medication or her underlying condition.

Given the results of the study, it has been determined that the investigational drug ID X13737 will be discontinued as the study is now complete. The patient will be advised to continue with her current treatment plan for her epilepsy and diabetes, and we will monitor her condition closely to assess any changes in her seizure activity or overall health. It is important to note that the patient's history of ADHD and depression may also need to be taken into consideration when developing her treatment plan.

In conclusion, this follow-up visit with Patient ID 47 has provided valuable information regarding the effectiveness and safety of the investigational drug ID X13737 for parietal lobe epilepsy. While the patient has experienced a significant number of seizures during the study period, it is unclear whether these seizures are directly related to the medication or her underlying condition. Further monitoring and analysis will be necessary to fully understand the results of this study and determine the best course of treatment for this patient.

CLINIC NOTE

Visit #1
Date: 2021-10-28
Patient ID: 68

Chief Complaint:

The patient, a 99-year-old male, presents with a history of bipolar disorder and epilepsy. He has experienced 13.0 seizures in the past two months. He is currently enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and is being treated with the investigational drug for epilepsy.

Past Medical History:

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and epilepsy, with a recent increase in seizure activity. He has been experiencing 13.0 seizures per month for the past two months.

Medication History:

The patient is currently taking lamotrigine (Lamictal) for his epilepsy and olanzapine (Zyprexa) for his bipolar disorder. He has been advised to continue these medications throughout the RCT.

Neurological Examination:

General: The patient appears well-oriented and alert. He is conscious and cooperative during the examination.

Motor: The patient has a normal muscle strength and tone. There are no signs of weakness or atrophy.

Sensory: The patient has a normal sensation to light touch, pinprick, and temperature. He does not have any sensory deficits.

Cerebellar Function: The patient's cerebellar function is normal, with no signs of ataxia or dysmetria.

Mental Status: The patient's mental status is normal, with no evidence of cognitive decline or psychosis.

Assessment and Plan:

Assessment: The patient's recent increase in seizure activity is concerning and may be related to the investigational drug for epilepsy that he is currently taking. However, given his history of bipolar disorder and epilepsy, it is possible that this increase in seizures may also be related to these underlying conditions.

Plan:

1. Continue the investigational drug for epilepsy for an additional three months, as per the RCT protocol.
2. Monitor the patient's seizure activity closely and adjust the dosage of the investigational drug as needed to control seizures.
3. Perform regular follow-up appointments to assess the patient's neurological status and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.
4. Encourage the patient to maintain a consistent sleep schedule and avoid alcohol and other medications that may interact with his current medications.
5. Consider adding another medication, such as levetiracetam (Keppra), to the patient's regimen if the seizures persist or worsen.

I have discussed the above plan with the patient and he has understood the risks and benefits of the investigational drug and the need for close monitoring of his seizure activity. He has been advised to follow up with me in two weeks for a reassessment of his neurological status.

Clinic Note Visit #1

Patient ID: 83

Date: 2021-12-25

History of Present Illness:

The patient, a 66-year-old male, presents with a history of hypothyroidism, dermatitis, and generalized epilepsy. He has experienced 9.0 seizures in the past 2 months. He is currently participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and has been advised not to make any changes to his medications other than adding the investigational drug for epilepsy, which he will take for 3 months.

Neurological Examination:

General: The patient appears well-nourished and in no acute distress. He has a normal facial expression and demonstrates no evidence of weakness or paresis.

Cerebellar Function: The patient's cerebellar function is normal, with no signs of ataxia or dysmetria.

Motor Function: The patient's motor function is normal, with no signs of weakness, paresis, or fasciculations.

Sensory Function: The patient's sensory function is normal, with no signs of sensory loss or deficits.

Coordination and Balance: The patient's coordination and balance are normal, with no signs of ataxia or dysmetria.

Reflexes: The patient's reflexes are normal, with no signs of hyporeflexia or hyperreflexia.

Muscle Strength: The patient's muscle strength is normal, with no signs of weakness or wasting.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's history of hypothyroidism, dermatitis, and generalized epilepsy, along with his recent increase in seizure activity, suggests a possible link between these conditions and the investigational drug he is currently taking as part of the RCT. However, given the lack of any significant changes to his medications other than the addition of the investigational drug, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of his increased seizure activity at this time.

The patient will continue to participate in the RCT and will take the investigational drug as prescribed for the next 3 months. His seizure activity will be closely monitored during this time, and any changes or concerns will be addressed promptly. The patient will also continue to receive standard care for his hypothyroidism and dermatitis as needed.

The patient's neurological examination was unremarkable, with no significant abnormalities detected. His cerebellar function, motor function, sensory function, coordination and balance, reflexes, and muscle strength were all within normal limits.

-------------- PATIENT ID 88 -- VISIT 2 -----------

On October 23rd, 2022, I had the pleasure of visiting Patient ID 88, a 99-year-old female who has been participating in a randomized controlled trial for her occipital lobe epilepsy. Over the past three months, the patient has been administered the investigational drug ID X13737, and during this time, she has experienced a significant reduction in seizures. Specifically, the patient has had only 16.0 seizures since starting the medication, which is a remarkable improvement compared to her previous seizure frequency.

Upon examination, the patient's neurological status was found to be unchanged from her previous visit. Her cognitive function remains intact, and she reports no new symptoms or adverse effects associated with the medication. It is worth noting that the patient has been extremely compliant with the study protocol, and her consistent reporting of seizure activity has been invaluable to the success of the trial.

Given that the study is now complete, it has been decided that the investigational drug ID X13737 will be discontinued. While this may be a disappointment to the patient, it is essential to ensure that the results of the study are not compromised by continued administration of the medication. I have taken the time to explain the rationale behind this decision to the patient, and she understands the importance of maintaining the integrity of the study.

In conclusion, Patient ID 88 has made significant progress during her participation in this randomized controlled trial. Her seizure frequency has decreased substantially, and her consistent reporting of symptoms has contributed significantly to the success of the study. Although the investigational drug will be discontinued, I am confident that the findings of this trial will contribute meaningfully to the advancement of occipital lobe epilepsy treatment.

The patient has been taking the drug for the past 3 months and has experienced 60.0 seizures during that time. The patient has also reported somnolence and balance disorder.

Reason for Visit:

The patient is presenting for a routine follow-up visit to assess the effectiveness of the investigational drug and to address any adverse effects.

Neurological Examination:

Mental Status: The patient appears alert and oriented. He does not have any evidence of cognitive impairment or change in mental status.

Speech: The patient's speech is clear and normal.

Cranial Nerves: All cranial nerves are intact, with no evidence of weakness or paresis.

Motor System: The patient has a normal strength and tone in all muscle groups. There is no evidence of ataxia or tremors.

Sensory System: The patient has a normal sensation in all modalities (touch, pain, temperature, and vibration).

Coordination and Balance: The patient has a slight balance disorder, which may be related to the investigational drug. He also reports somnolence, which may affect his coordination and balance.

Reflexes: All reflexes are normal.

Assessment and Plan:

Based on the patient's history of multifocal epilepsy and the results of the neurological examination, it is clear that the investigational drug ID X13737 has been effective in reducing seizure frequency. However, the patient has experienced somnolence and balance disorder as adverse effects. These effects are consistent with the known side effects of the drug.

Given the completion of the RCT and the discontinuation of the investigational drug, the patient will be transitioned to standard therapy for his epilepsy. The patient's seizure frequency will be closely monitored, and any changes in medication or dosage will be made as needed.

The patient will also be referred to physical therapy to address his balance disorder. Additionally, the patient's depression and anxiety will be monitored and treated as needed.

Future Follow-Up:

The patient will be seen for follow-up appointments every 3 months to assess seizure frequency, medication efficacy, and any changes in mental status or adverse effects.

On June 21st, 2021, Patient ID 101, a 33-year-old male with a history of dermatitis and epilepsy, presented for his first clinic visit. The patient has been experiencing an increase in seizure activity over the past two months, with a total of 183.0 seizures. Notably, this patient is currently participating in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an investigational drug for the treatment of epilepsy.

Upon examination, the patient's neurological status was found to be unchanged from previous evaluations. The patient continues to experience mild cognitive impairment and difficulty with short-term memory, but these deficits have remained stable over time. The patient's speech and language skills are also unaffected. The patient's seizures remain well-controlled on his current medication regimen, which includes levetiracetam and valproate sodium.

The patient reported no new medication side effects or changes in symptoms since the last evaluation. However, the patient did express concern about the ongoing seizure activity and the potential impact on their quality of life. The patient was reassured that the investigational drug being used in the randomized controlled trial has shown promise in reducing seizure frequency and improving cognitive function in patients with similar medical histories.

In light of the patient's current clinical status and the ongoing randomized controlled trial, it is recommended that the patient continue their current medication regimen with no changes made other than adding the investigational drug for epilepsy. The patient will be monitored closely over the next three months to assess the efficacy of the investigational drug and make any necessary adjustments to their treatment plan. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to ensure the patient's ongoing care and monitor their seizure activity and cognitive function.

On July 17, 2022, I conducted a follow-up visit with Patient ID 103, a 29-year-old female who has been participating in a randomized controlled trial for the investigational drug ID X13737. Over the past three months, the patient has been taking the medication and has experienced 16.0 seizures. Notably, the patient has reported no symptoms despite this high frequency of seizures.

During the neurological examination, I observed no significant abnormalities in the patient's cognitive or motor functions. Her speech was clear and coherent, and her memory and attention span were within normal limits. The patient's sensory neurons were also normal, with no evidence of numbness, tingling, or weakness in any part of her body. Additionally, I did not detect any signs of seizure activity, such as tremors, rigidity, or altered state of consciousness.

Given the high frequency of seizures experienced by the patient during the trial period, it is clear that ID X13737 has had a significant impact on her epilepsy symptoms. However, since the study is now complete and the investigational drug will be discontinued, it is essential to monitor the patient's seizure activity closely in the coming months to determine if this effect persists. Furthermore, I recommend that the patient continue with her current medication regimen to ensure optimal control of her epilepsy symptoms.

In conclusion, Patient ID 103 has tolerated the investigational drug ID X13737 well, with no significant adverse effects or symptoms reported during the study period. Her neurological examination revealed no abnormalities, and her epilepsy symptoms have been effectively managed. However, close monitoring is necessary to determine if the therapeutic effects of the drug persist after its discontinuation.

-------------- PATIENT ID 122 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On February 2nd, 2022, I had the pleasure of conducting the first clinic visit for Patient ID 122, a 62-year-old male with a history of frontal lobe epilepsy. The patient has been experiencing an increased frequency of seizures over the past two months, with a total of 13 seizures during this time frame. This is a significant concern for the patient and warrants close monitoring and potential intervention.

During the clinic visit, I performed a comprehensive neurological examination to assess the patient's current condition. The examination revealed no notable changes in the patient's physical appearance or gross motor function. However, the patient did report ongoing seizure activity, which was confirmed by the presence of postictal confusional state and transient aphasia. The patient also complained of increased fatigue and difficulty with concentration, which may be related to the seizures.

The patient is currently enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for the treatment of frontal lobe epilepsy. As part of this study, the patient will be taking an investigational drug for epilepsy for a period of three months. The primary goal of this RCT is to assess the efficacy and safety of this new drug compared to standard-of-care treatments for frontal lobe epilepsy. During the clinic visit, I reviewed the study protocol with the patient and addressed any questions or concerns they may have had.

Given the patient's history of frontal lobe epilepsy and recent increase in seizure frequency, it is essential that we closely monitor their condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed. The addition of the investigational drug to the patient's regimen may help to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures, and we will be closely tracking the patient's response to this intervention over the next several months.

-------------- PATIENT ID 123 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On April 2nd, 2022, Patient ID 123, an 18-year-old male, presented to the clinic for his first visit. The patient has a history of seasonal allergies, ADHD, and frontal lobe epilepsy. He has experienced 14 seizures over the past two months, which is concerning as it is an increase from his usual frequency.

During the neurological examination, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. His general appearance was alert and conscious, with no evidence of abnormal movements or tremors. His speech was clear and coherent, with no apparent difficulties with language or cognition. The patient's reflexes were normal, and there was no significant weakness or paresis in any extremities.

The patient's neurological examination revealed a few noteworthy findings. His tone was slightly increased throughout his body, with more noticeable rigidity in his neck and shoulder muscles. There was also a trace of an intention tremor observed in his hands when he extended his fingers. Additionally, the patient had a subtle slowing of his speech and movements, which is consistent with his history of frontal lobe epilepsy.

Due to the patient's recent increase in seizures, it has been decided that he will be entering a randomized controlled trial for the investigational drug being studied for epilepsy. The patient will be taking this medication for three months, and no changes will be made to his current medications other than adding the new study drug. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's seizure activity during this time to assess the efficacy of the investigational drug. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to track the patient's progress and make any necessary adjustments to his treatment plan.

Clinic Note Visit #1

Patient ID: 125
Date: 2022-09-14

Identification:

I am pleased to present the following clinic note for Patient ID 125, a 72-year-old male with an illustrious history of bipolar disorder, ADHD, and generalized epilepsy. Our esteemed patient has graced us with his presence on this auspicious day, September 14th, 2022.

Historical Perspective (HP):

Our distinguished patient has been grappling with the affliction of bipolar disorder for the past three decades, and has exhibited remarkable resilience in the face of this formidable challenge. In addition, he has been diagnosed with ADHD and generalized epilepsy, which have further compounded his burden.

Subjective:

Upon inquiring about the patient's subjective experience, he disclosed that he has been enduring an unprecedented level of seizure activity over the past two months, with a total of four seizures. These seizures have been characterized by sudden losses of consciousness and convulsions, causing significant distress and impairment in his daily life.

Medications:

Our patient has been prescribed an impressive array of medications to manage his conditions, including lithium carbonate, methylphenidate, and valproic acid. He has been adhering to these regimens with commendable dedication, as evident from the meticulous records kept by his caregivers.

Allergies:

Upon thorough probing, our patient has revealed no allergies or sensitivities to any medications or substances.

Social History:

Our esteemed patient has been blessed with a loving spouse and two grown children, who have been providing invaluable support throughout his journey. He has been working part-time as an artist, which he finds incredibly fulfilling. However, his condition has forced him to reduce his workload considerably.

Review of Systems (ROS):

During the review of systems, our patient reported experiencing no significant complaints other than those related to seizure activity. He did, however, express some mild cognitive difficulties, which he attributes to the burden of his multiple conditions.

General Physical Examination (GPE):

Upon performing a thorough general physical examination, I observed no remarkable findings other than a subtle tremor in the patient's hands. His vital signs were within normal limits, and his overall physical condition was found to be stable.

Comprehensive Neurologic Exam (CNE):

The comprehensive neurologic exam revealed no obvious abnormalities in the patient's cranial nerves, motor function, or sensory perception. However, he did exhibit a subtle degree of rigidity and bradykinesia, which are common manifestations of Parkinson's disease. His speech was found to be clear and coherent, with no evidence of dysarthria or other communication disorders.

Labs:

Recent laboratory tests have confirmed the patient's diagnosis of generalized epilepsy, with elevated levels of sodium and potassium in his serum. His renal function is within normal limits, and his liver enzymes are slightly elevated, consistent with prior episodes of seizure activity.

Imaging:

A thorough review of the patient's imaging studies has revealed no notable abnormalities, including no evidence of structural brain lesions or other anatomical alterations. His MRI scan did reveal some subtle atrophy in the temporal lobe, which is consistent with his long-standing history of seizure activity.

Assessment:

Based on the patient's comprehensive neurological examination and laboratory findings, I have reached the following assessments:

1. Bipolar disorder: The patient has been grappling with this condition for several decades, and his current symptoms are consistent with a manic episode.
2. ADHD: The patient's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has been well-controlled by his current medication regimen.
3. Generalized epilepsy: The patient's recent seizure activity is a manifestation of this condition, and the results of his laboratory tests and imaging studies are consistent with this diagnosis.
4. Parkinson's disease: The patient's subtle tremor and rigidity are indicative of this condition, which is not uncommon in patients with long-standing epilepsy.

Plan:

In light of the above assessments, I have devised a comprehensive plan for our esteemed patient, as follows:

1. Continue the patient's existing medication regimen, including lithium carbonate, methylphenidate, and valproic acid, with careful monitoring of his serum levels and any adjustments as needed.
2. Add an investigational drug for epilepsy, which will be taken for a period of three months to assess its efficacy in reducing seizure activity.
3. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's condition and adjust his medication regimen accordingly.

CLINIC NOTE #2

Date: August 6, 2022

Patient ID: 129

Age: 27 years old

Gender: Female

Chief Complaint: Vertigo and multifocal epilepsy

History of Present Illness:

The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of multifocal epilepsy. Over the past 3 months, she has been participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and has been receiving the investigational drug ID X13737 for her epilepsy. During this time, she has experienced 42 seizures. The patient has also reported vertigo.

Past Medical History:

The patient has a history of multifocal epilepsy and has been experiencing seizures since the age of 10. She has tried various anticonvulsant medications, including levetiracetam, valproic acid, and lamotrigine, but has not achieved complete seizure control.

Current Medications:

The patient is currently taking levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily, valproic acid 2000 mg twice daily, and lamotrigine 200 mg once daily. She has also been receiving the investigational drug ID X13737 500 mg twice daily as part of the RCT.

Social History:

The patient is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. She lives with her husband and two children. She reports no significant stressors or changes in her life recently.

Review of Systems:

General: The patient denies fever, chills, or fatigue.

Neurological: The patient reports vertigo and has had 42 seizures over the past 3 months. She also experiences frequent headaches and difficulty with memory and concentration.

Psychiatric: The patient denies any psychiatric symptoms.

Musculoskeletal: The patient denies any musculoskeletal symptoms.

Other: The patient reports no other symptoms or concerns.

Physical Examination:

General: The patient appears well-nourished and well-oriented. Her speech is clear and her affect is appropriate.

Neurological: The patient has a normal gross motor examination. She has a slight limb weakness on the right side of her body, which is consistent with her history of multifocal epilepsy. Her sensory examination reveals decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick on the left side of her body, consistent with her reported vertigo. Her reflexes are normal.

Cranial Nerve Examination:

The patient has normal visual acuity and fields. Her extraocular movements are full and normal. Her oculomotor and trochlear muscles are intact. She has a slight weakness of her abducens nerve, consistent with her history of multifocal epilepsy.

Mental Status Examination:

The patient's mental status is normal. Her memory and concentration appear to be intact. She denies any hallucinations or delusions.

Assessment and Plan:

Based on the patient's history of multifocal epilepsy and her recent experience with 42 seizures over the past 3 months, it is clear that she continues to experience significant seizure activity despite being on multiple anticonvulsant medications. The investigational drug ID X13737 has not been effective in controlling her seizures, and its discontinuation is appropriate now that the RCT is complete.

The patient's vertigo and slight limb weakness on the right side of her body are consistent with her history of multifocal epilepsy and suggest ongoing seizure activity. Her decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick on the left side of her body may be related to her reported vertigo.

The patient's mental status is normal, and she denies any hallucinations or delusions. However, her history of multifocal epilepsy and recent experience with seizures suggest that she may be at risk for cognitive impairment or psychiatric symptoms.

Plan:

1. Discontinue the investigational drug ID X13737.
2. Increase the dose of levetiracetam to 1000 mg twice daily and valproic acid to 2500 mg twice daily to further optimize seizure control.
3. Add lamotrigine 500 mg once daily to the patient's regimen to provide additional seizure control.
4. Monitor the patient closely for any changes in her seizure activity or cognitive function over the next 6-12 months.
5. Consider referring the patient to a neuropsychologist or cognitive behavioral therapist to address any potential cognitive impairment or psychiatric symptoms.

-------------- PATIENT ID 141 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On August 11, 2021, I attended a clinic visit with Patient ID 141, an 18-year-old female who has been experiencing increased seizure activity over the past two months. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, asthma, and frontal lobe epilepsy, which we have been closely monitoring and managing with medication.

During this visit, I conducted a comprehensive neurological examination to assess the patient's current condition. Her vital signs were within normal limits, and she appeared alert and focused. On inspection, there were no abnormalities noted in her head, face, or neck. Her speech was clear and coherent, and her language skills were intact. The patient's cognitive function was also within normal limits, and she was able to perform simple calculations and recall recent events without any difficulties.

The patient reported that she had experienced eight seizures in the past two months, which is a significant increase from her previous baseline. She also mentioned that she has been experiencing some mild dizziness and blurred vision, but these symptoms are not severe enough to interfere with her daily activities. I reviewed the patient's medication regimen and confirmed that no changes will be made at this time, other than adding the investigational drug for epilepsy that will be taken for three months as part of a randomized controlled trial. The patient understands the purpose and potential risks and benefits of this trial and has provided her informed consent.

Overall, Patient ID 141 is in good health and her neurological examination revealed no significant abnormalities. However, her increased seizure activity remains a concern and we will continue to monitor her closely and adjust her medication regimen as needed to manage her condition effectively.

Age: 18 years

Gender: Female

Chief Complaint: Balance disorder, history of hypothyroidism, asthma, and frontal lobe epilepsy

History of Present Illness:

The patient has been participating in a randomized controlled trial for the investigational drug ID X13737 for the treatment of frontal lobe epilepsy. She has been taking the medication for the past 3 months and has experienced 29 seizures during this time. The patient has also reported a balance disorder.

Past Medical History:

* Hypothyroidism (diagnosed at age 15)
* Asthma (diagnosed at age 8)
* Frontal lobe epilepsy (diagnosed at age 12)

Medications:

* Levothyroxine (thyroid hormone replacement)
* Albuterol (asthma medication)
* Lamotrigine (anticonvulsant medication)

Social History:

* No known allergies
* Non-smoker
* Denies alcohol or illicit drug use

Review of Systems:

* Headache: None
* Dizziness/Vertigo: Yes, patient reports balance disorder
* Fatigue: None
* Muscle weakness: None
* Paresthesias: None

Physical Examination:

* Vital Signs:
	+ Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)
	+ Blood Pressure: 120/80 mmHg
	+ Pulse Rate: 70 beats per minute
	+ Respiratory Rate: 14 breaths per minute
* General: Alert and oriented, cooperative and pleasant
* Neurological:
	+ Cranial Nerves: All grossly normal
	+ Motor Exam: All extremities are normocephalic and normochromic. No evidence of weakness or atrophy.
	+ Sensory Exam: Patient reports decreased sensation in the right arm and leg, which is consistent with her history of frontal lobe epilepsy.

* Special Senses: No abnormalities noted in vision or hearing.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's history of frontal lobe epilepsy, hypothyroidism, and asthma, along with her recent experience of 29 seizures during the investigational drug trial, suggest that she is at high risk for seizure activity. The patient's current balance disorder is likely related to her seizure activity and may require further evaluation and management.

The patient will be advised to discontinue the investigational drug, ID X13737, as it is no longer necessary for the study. The patient's thyroid hormone replacement medication will be re-evaluated to ensure that her hypothyroidism is adequately controlled. Additionally, the patient's asthma medication will be reviewed to ensure that it is appropriate for her condition.

The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 1 month to monitor her seizure activity and to reassess her balance disorder. In the meantime, the patient should avoid any activities that may exacerbate her balance problems and should report any changes in her symptoms or seizure activity to our office immediately.

Documentation:

* The patient has been advised of the risks and benefits of the investigational drug trial and has given informed consent for participation.
* The patient has been prescribed levothyroxine and albuterol for her pre-existing conditions.

  Sure, here's the clinic note for Patient ID 149, a 42-year-old female with a history of diabetes, seasonal allergies, and multifocal epilepsy:

Identification:

Patient ID: 149
Date of Birth: March 15, 1980
Gender: Female

HPI (History of Present Illness):

The patient presents with a history of diabetes, seasonal allergies, and multifocal epilepsy. She has been participating in a randomized controlled trial for the investigational drug ID X13737 for epilepsy over the past 3 months. During this time, she has experienced 108 seizures. The patient also reports balance disorder.

Subjective:

The patient reports feeling generally unwell and experiencing persistent seizures since starting the investigational drug. She also complains of balance difficulties, which have been ongoing for the past month. The patient describes her seizures as "like a thousand needles stabbing my brain at once." She has noticed that her seizures tend to occur more frequently during periods of high stress and when she is not adherent to her medication regimen.

Medications:

* ID X13737 (Investigational drug for epilepsy): Discontinued due to completion of the randomized controlled trial
* Levetiracetam (Keppra) 500mg BID
* Lamotrigine (Lamictal) 200mg OD
* Metformin (Glucophage) 1000mg BID

Allergies:

None reported

Social history:

The patient is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. She lives with her husband and two children. The patient reports that she has been experiencing increased stress due to the recent loss of her job. She also reports that she has been having difficulty sleeping at night due to her seizures.

Review of Systems:

Neurological: The patient reports persistent seizures, balance difficulties, and "brain fog"
Cardiovascular: The patient denies any cardiovascular symptoms
Respiratory: The patient reports mild shortness of breath
Gastrointestinal: The patient reports nausea and vomiting

General Physical Examination:

The patient appears thin and pale, with a height of 5'8" and a weight of 130 lbs. Her blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, and her heart rate is 88 beats per minute. The patient's head is normocephalic and ataxic. Her speech is clear and coherent. Her extraocular movements are intact. Her hearing and vision are within normal limits. The patient's reflexes are decreased bilaterally. Her sensory examination reveals decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick over the left hemi-body.

Comprehensive Neurologic Exam:

The patient presents with a history of multifocal epilepsy, which is consistent with her neurological examination findings. She exhibits decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick over the left hemi-body, indicating a possible seizure focus in this area. Her speech is clear and coherent, but she reports difficulty with balance and "brain fog." The patient's reflexes are decreased bilaterally, which may indicate peripheral neuropathy or a seizure disorder.

Labs:

* Glucose (fasting): 120 mg/dL
* Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): 7.5%
* Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): 4.2 μIU/mL
* Lipid profile: Within normal limits
* Complete blood count (CBC): Within normal limits

Imaging:

* MRI brain: No evidence of structural abnormalities or lesions

Assessment:

The patient's persistent seizures, balance difficulties, and "brain fog" are concerning. The recent loss of her job and difficulty sleeping may be contributing to her increased stress levels, which may be exacerbating her seizure disorder. The patient's decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick over the left hemi-body may indicate a possible seizure focus in this area. Her history of multifocal epilepsy and decreased reflexes suggest a possible peripheral neuropathy or seizure disorder.

Plan:

1. The patient will be referred to an epileptologist for further evaluation and management of her seizure disorder.
2. The patient's investigational drug, ID X13737, will be discontinued due to completion of the randomized controlled trial.

-------------- PATIENT ID 160 -- VISIT 2 -----------

On March 24, 2023, I conducted a follow-up visit with Patient ID 160, a 37-year-old male who has been participating in a randomized controlled trial for the investigational drug ID X13737 for his temporal lobe epilepsy. Over the past three months, the patient has taken the medication and has experienced 14 seizures during this time period. Additionally, the patient reported experiencing somnolence while taking the drug.

Upon conducting a complete neurological examination, I noted that the patient's cognitive function and memory were intact, and there were no noticeable changes in his motor function or coordination. However, I did observe some mild tremors in the patient's hands and feet, which is consistent with the patient's history of arthritis. The patient's sensory functions, including vision and hearing, were also within normal limits.

Given the patient's experience of somnolence and the 14 seizures that occurred during the study period, it has been decided that the investigational drug ID X13737 will be discontinued. While the drug showed promise in controlling the patient's epilepsy, the risks associated with its use have outweighed the benefits. The patient will be closely monitored and managed with alternative medications to ensure his continued well-being.

In conclusion, this follow-up visit with Patient ID 160 has revealed some valuable insights into the effects of the investigational drug ID X13737 on his temporal lobe epilepsy. While the drug showed some promise, it is clear that its use is not without risk and alternative medications will be used to manage the patient's condition going forward.

* Mental Status: The patient's cognitive function was normal, with no evidence of decline or impairment.
* Speech and Language: The patient's speech was clear and coherent, with no noticeable difficulties or abnormalities.
* Motor Function: The patient's motor function was generally intact, with no significant tremors, rigidity, or weakness observed. However, there was a mild degree of dizziness noted during the examination.
* Sensory Function: The patient's sensory function was largely normal, with no deficits in vision, hearing, or sensation noted.
* Reflexes: The patient's reflexes were generally brisk and appropriate to the stimuli applied.

Given the patient's history of multifocal epilepsy and the significant number of seizures experienced during the study period, it is apparent that the investigational drug ID X13737 has had a limited impact on the patient's condition. Additionally, the patient's report of dizziness suggests a potential adverse effect of the medication. In light of these findings and the completion of the study, it is recommended that the investigational drug be discontinued, and alternative therapies be considered to address the patient's ongoing seizure activity.

CLINIC NOTE #1 (2021-07-17)

Patient ID: 188

Name: [Mr./Mrs./Ms.] [Last Name]

Age: 94 years

Gender: Male

Chief Complaint: Seizures

History of Present Illness:

The patient, a 94-year-old male with a history of autism and temporal lobe epilepsy, has been experiencing an unusual increase in seizure activity over the past two months. He has had 58 seizures during this time frame, which is significantly higher than his usual frequency. The patient is currently enrolled in a randomized controlled trial investigating a new medication for the treatment of epilepsy.

Review of Systems:

The patient's medical history is significant for autism and temporal lobe epilepsy, as previously mentioned. He has a history of seizures dating back to his early 20s, with a previous diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The patient has been treated with levetiracetam and sodium valproate for the past several years, with minimal side effects reported. He has no history of allergies or sensitivities to any medications.

Social History:

The patient resides in a long-term care facility and is accompanied by his primary caregiver during clinic visits. He is well-cared for and has no notable social or family history. The patient is unable to communicate effectively due to his autism diagnosis, but he appears to be content and cooperative during the clinic visit.

Medications:

The patient's current medication regimen includes levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily and sodium valproate 500 mg twice daily. He has been adherent to his medication regimen, with no reported missed doses or side effects.

Allergies:

The patient has no known allergies to any medications.

Labs:

Recent laboratory studies, including a complete blood count and electrolyte panel, have been unremarkable. The patient's most recent electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed a marked increase in spike wave discharges, consistent with his diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy.

Imaging:

The patient's most recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed no acute changes or lesions. There is evidence of previous scar tissue in the temporal lobes, consistent with his history of seizures.

Assessment:

Given the patient's history of autism and temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as his recent increase in seizure activity, it is necessary to continue monitoring his condition closely. The patient's current medication regimen will be maintained, with the addition of the investigational drug for epilepsy. This trial medication will be taken for a period of three months, and the patient's response will be closely monitored.

Plan:

1. Continue the patient's current medication regimen, including levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily and sodium valproate 500 mg twice daily.
2. Add the investigational drug for epilepsy, to be taken for a period of three months.

This patient has been participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the efficacy and safety of the novel compound ID X13737 for treating intractable temporal lobe epilepsy.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient has been adherent to the study protocol, having received ID X13737 daily for the past three months. During this time, he has experienced an unfortunate increase in seizure frequency, with 43 seizures documented over the past 90 days (a 38% increase compared to the baseline period).

Subjective:
At today's visit, the patient reported a pervasive sense of somnolence and lethargy, which he attributes to the investigational drug. He also complained of progressive memory loss and difficulty concentrating, both of which may be related to the study medication or underlying temporal lobe pathology.

Medications:
The patient has been compliant with the ID X13737 dosing regimen (250mg QD x 3 months). He has also been taking levetiracetam (500mg BID) and lacosamide (200mg BID) as adjunctive therapy for his refractory temporal lobe epilepsy.

Allergies:
The patient has no known allergies or sensitivities to any medications or substances.

Social History:
The patient resides in a long-term care facility and is well cared for by the staff. He has limited social interaction due to his advanced age and cognitive limitations. The patient's family members are active in his care, visiting regularly and communicating with the study team as needed.

Review of Systems (ROS):
The patient has a history of autism, which manifests as significant social and communication deficits. He also experiences recurrent temporal lobe seizures, which have been challenging to control despite prior trials of various anticonvulsants. The patient reports no other relevant medical or psychiatric history.

General Physical Examination:
On today's examination, the patient appeared well-nourished and well-groomed, with no acute distress or discomfort. His vital signs were within normal limits (BP 120/80 mmHg, HR 72 beats per minute, T 98.6°F). A comprehensive neurological examination was performed and revealed the following:

* Cranial nerves: The patient demonstrated a mild left-sided hemiparesis, with subtle weakness of the left arm and leg. There was no evidence of abnormal reflexes or sensory deficits.
* Motor examination: The patient exhibited a gradual decrease in muscle tone and power, particularly in the left upper limb. There were no signs of ataxia or dysmetria.
* Sensory examination: The patient showed normal sensation to light touch, pinprick, and temperature on both sides of the body. No sensory deficits were identified.

Comprehensive Neurological Exam:

The patient underwent a comprehensive neurological exam, including assessment of cognitive function, mood, and behavior. The following observations were made:

* Cognition: The patient demonstrated significant cognitive impairment, with difficulty remembering recent events and learning new information. His performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 18/30, indicating moderate dementia.
* Mood: The patient reported a flat affect and displayed limited emotional responsiveness during the examination. There were no signs of overt mood disorder or psychosis.
* Behavior: The patient exhibited significant difficulty with social interaction and communication, consistent with his diagnosed autism spectrum disorder. He demonstrated no aggressive or violent behavior during the visit.

Labs:
The patient's recent laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 4.5 x 109/L, NEUT 3.2 x 109/L, LYMP 1.1 x 109/L, MONO 6.8 x 109/L, EOSIN 11.5%.
* Blood Chemistry: Sodium 138 mmol/L, Potassium 4.2 mmol/L, Chloride 102 mmol/L, CO2 22 mmol/L, Glucose 150 mg/dL, BUN 20 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.5 mg/dL.
* Urinalysis: Clear yellow urine with no visible blood or pyuria.

Imaging:
The patient has undergone serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to assess for changes in brain structure and function over time. The most recent MRI scan revealed mild atrophy of the temporal lobes, consistent with the patient's history of autism and temporal lobe epilepsy.

Assessment:
In light of the patient's recent increase in seizure frequency while taking ID X13737, it is my professional opinion that discontinuing this medication is warranted at this time. Additionally, the patient's cognitive impairment and flat affect may be related to the study medication or underlying temporal lobe pathology, and further evaluation and management are necessary to address these issues. The patient's autism spectrum disorder and refractory temporal lobe epilepsy pose ongoing challenges for optimal clinical management.

Plan:
Given the patient's recent seizure increase while taking ID X13737, we will discontinue this medication immediately. The patient will be transitioned to standard therapy for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, consisting of levetiracetam and lacosamide. We will closely monitor the patient's seizure frequency and adjust the dosages of these medications as needed. The patient will undergo regular follow-up evaluations to assess for changes in cognitive function, mood, and behavior.

-------------- PATIENT ID 207 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On February 15, 2022, I conducted visit #1 with Patient ID 207, a 22-year-old male who presented with a history of ADHD, dermatitis, asthma, and parietal lobe epilepsy. The patient has had an alarming increase in seizures over the past two months, with a total of 34 seizures reported. Notably, this increase in seizures coincides with the patient's participation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating a new drug for epilepsy.

Upon examination, the patient's neurological status was found to be stable, with no notable changes since the previous visit. The patient reported no recent medication changes or triggers that may have contributed to the increased seizure activity. However, the patient did report experiencing more frequent and intense seizures since initiating the RCT, which is a common side effect of the investigational drug being used.

As part of the RCT, the patient has been prescribed the investigational drug for epilepsy for a period of three months. The addition of this drug to the patient's existing medication regimen is intended to evaluate its efficacy in managing seizures. However, no changes will be made to the patient's current medications other than the addition of the investigational drug. This decision was made after careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits of the new drug, as well as consultation with the patient's primary care physician and neurologist.

Overall, the patient's condition remains stable, but the recent increase in seizures is a cause for concern. Close monitoring and regular follow-up visits will be crucial to assess the effectiveness of the investigational drug and manage any potential side effects or complications. Additionally, it will be essential to continue evaluating the patient's neurological status and adjusting their medication regimen as needed to ensure optimal seizure control and overall health.

On November 7th, 2022, I had the pleasure of conducting visit #1 with Patient ID 208, an 87-year-old male who presented with a history of generalized epilepsy and recent increase in seizure activity. Over the past two months, the patient has experienced seven seizures, which is a significant change from their previous frequency of one to two seizures per month.

During the examination, I conducted a thorough neurological assessment of the patient's cognitive and motor functions, including checks for memory, speech, language, balance, coordination, and reflexes. The patient's cognitive function was found to be intact, with no signs of decline or impairment. However, their motor function showed mild weakness on the left side of their body, which may be related to the patient's history of seizures.

The patient is currently participating in a randomized controlled trial for the treatment of their epilepsy, and no changes will be made to their medication regimen at this time, other than the addition of the investigational drug for epilepsy. This new medication will be administered for a period of three months, after which its effectiveness will be re-evaluated. The patient has been instructed to continue with their regular seizure medications and to report any changes in their seizure activity or side effects from the new medication.

In conclusion, visit #1 with Patient ID 208 revealed a patient with a history of generalized epilepsy and increased seizure activity over the past two months. While the patient's cognitive function remains intact, mild weakness on the left side of their body was noted. The patient will continue to participate in the randomized controlled trial with no changes to their medication regimen at this time, other than the addition of the investigational drug for epilepsy.

On examination, the patient's vital signs were normal, with a temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and a heart rate of 70 beats per minute. The patient's neurological examination revealed no significant abnormalities, including a normal cognitive function, normal sensory examination, and normal motor function. However, the patient did exhibit some subtle abnormalities in his speech and language, which are consistent with his history of autism.

Plan: The patient will continue to receive the investigational drug for epilepsy for a period of three months. No changes will be made to the patient's current medications other than the addition of the investigational drug. The patient will be closely monitored for any adverse effects or changes in his seizure frequency during this time. The patient will be followed up with at the end of the three-month period to assess the efficacy of the investigational drug and make any necessary adjustments to his treatment plan.

Note: Throughout the course of this clinical trial, it is essential that the patient adhere to the study medication and follow-up schedule to ensure accurate data collection and meaningful results. The patient will be informed of the potential risks and benefits of the investigational drug and will be asked to provide written informed consent before starting the trial.

* CT scan of head, neck, and spine: No acute or chronic abnormalities noted.
* MRI of brain: No evidence of structural or metabolic abnormalities detected.

Assessment:

Patient presents with a history of recurrent seizures, which have increased in frequency over the past two months. The patient is participating in a randomized controlled trial and has been compliant with all study-related procedures and medications. Laboratory and imaging results are within normal limits. Based on the patient's history and current presentation, it is reasonable to suspect that the increased seizure activity may be related to the underlying epilepsy diagnosis.

Plan:

1. Continue all current medications as prescribed.
2. Add investigational drug for epilepsy (levetiracetam) at a dose of 500mg BID for a period of 3 months.
3. Monitor patient's seizure activity and adjust medications as needed.
4. Schedule follow-up visit in 1 month to assess patient's response to treatment and monitor for any changes in symptoms or laboratory results.
