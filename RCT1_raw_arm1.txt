-------------- PATIENT ID 10 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On July 20, 2022, Patient ID 10, a 30-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism and multifocal epilepsy, presented to the clinic for his first follow-up visit since enrolling in a randomized controlled trial. The patient had experienced 43 seizures in the past two months, a significant increase from his previous seizure activity.

During the examination, the patient was alert and coherent, with no signs of confusion or disorientation. His speech was clear and well-spoken, with no observable tremors or weakness in his extremities. The patient's neck was stable, and there were no signs of muscle wasting or weakness. His reflexes were normal, and there was no evidence of sensory deficits or abnormalities.

The patient's neurological examination revealed no significant changes from the previous visit. However, the patient did report an increase in seizure activity since beginning the trial, with a total of 43 seizures in the past two months. The patient also reported some mild side effects, including headaches and fatigue, which were tolerable and not significantly impacting his daily activities.

In light of the patient's ongoing participation in the randomized controlled trial, no changes will be made to his current medications other than adding the investigational drug for epilepsy. The patient will continue to take this medication for a period of three months, after which time we will reassess his seizure activity and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.

-------------- PATIENT ID 10 -- VISIT 2 -----------

On August 20, 2022, I conducted a routine follow-up visit with Patient ID 10, a 30-year-old male who has been participating in a randomized controlled trial for the investigational drug ID X93461. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and multifocal epilepsy. Over the past three months, the patient has taken the investigational drug and has reported experiencing 23.0 seizures during this time period. Notably, the patient has also reported feeling fatigued.

Upon conducting a complete neurological examination, I observed that the patient's cognitive function and memory appear to be intact. However, there was evidence of mild bilateral sensorimotor axial hyperreflexia, which may be indicative of the patient's multifocal epilepsy. The patient's speech was clear and coherent, with no evidence of dysarthria or aphasia. The patient's language skills were intact, and they were able to communicate effectively.

Given the results of the study and the patient's experience with the investigational drug, it has been determined that the drug will be discontinued. The patient will be transitioned back to their standard medication regimen for their epilepsy, and we will monitor their condition closely to assess the effectiveness of this change. Additionally, we will continue to monitor the patient's fatigue levels and adjust their treatment plan as needed to ensure their quality of life is maintained.

In conclusion, Patient ID 10 has completed their participation in the randomized controlled trial for the investigational drug ID X93461. The results of the study suggest that the drug may be effective in reducing seizure frequency, but further research is needed to confirm these findings. The patient will be transitioned back to their standard medication regimen, and we will continue to monitor their condition closely to ensure their ongoing health and well-being.

The patient's symptoms of dizziness, somnolence, fall, and gait disturbance are likely related to the investigational drug ID X93461, which will be discontinued now that the study is complete. The patient's history of ADHD, hypothyroidism, autism, and generalized epilepsy may also contribute to these symptoms.

Plan:

1. Discontinue investigational drug ID X93461.
2. Monitor the patient's seizure activity and symptoms closely in the coming weeks.
3. Consider alternative therapies for the patient's epilepsy, as needed.
4. Follow up with the patient in 1-2 weeks to assess for any changes in his symptoms and to monitor the effectiveness of any interventions implemented.

Note: The patient's participation in the RCT is being discontinued, but he will continue to receive regular follow-up care for his epilepsy and other comorbid conditions.

-------------- PATIENT ID 19 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On December 12th, 2021, I conducted a clinic visit with Patient ID 19, a 31-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, dermatitis, and temporal lobe epilepsy. The patient has had 21.0 seizures in the past two months, and is currently participating in a randomized controlled trial. The purpose of this visit was to assess the patient's condition and monitor his progress in the trial.

Upon examination, the patient appeared alert and oriented, with normal speech and thought processes. His mood was euthymic, and he did not report any significant changes in his symptoms since the last visit. The patient's dermatitis appeared mild, with only a few scattered papules and plaques on his face and arms. His temporal lobe epilepsy was stable, with no recent seizures reported.

I performed a complete neurological examination, including an assessment of the patient's cognitive function, sensory systems, and motor function. The patient's cognitive function was within normal limits, and he demonstrated intact memory and attention. His sensory systems were also normal, with no deficits in vision, hearing, or sensation. The patient's motor function was slightly weakened, but this was attributed to his history of temporal lobe epilepsy.

In light of the patient's history and current condition, I have decided to continue the investigational drug for epilepsy for an additional three months. This medication has been effective in controlling the patient's seizures, and it is important to continue it in order to maintain his stability. The patient will be monitored closely throughout the course of the trial, with regular follow-up visits to assess his progress and adjust the treatment as needed.

-------------- PATIENT ID 33 -- VISIT 2 -----------

Clinic Note - Visit #2 dated 2021-07-07 for Patient ID 33

Patient Summary:

This is a 98-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension and generalized epilepsy. The patient has been participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the safety and efficacy of investigational drug ID X93461 for the treatment of epilepsy.

Neurological Examination:

On today's visit, the patient reported experiencing 12.0 seizures over the past three months since initiating treatment with ID X93461. The patient also complained of dizziness and headaches, as well as diplopia (double vision). These symptoms were mild to moderate in severity.

On examination, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. There was no evidence of focal neurological deficits or sensory loss. The patient had a stable gait and there were no signs of ataxia or dysmetria. However, the patient did exhibit mild diplopia when attempting to focus on near objects.

The results of the neurological examination suggest that the investigational drug ID X93461 has been associated with some adverse effects, including seizures and visual disturbances. These findings are consistent with previous reports of the drug's efficacy in reducing seizure frequency but also causing mild to moderate side effects such as dizziness and diplopia.

Course of Treatment:

Given the results of the neurological examination and the patient's history of hypertension and generalized epilepsy, it has been determined that the investigational drug ID X93461 will be discontinued. The study has now been completed and the patient will be transitioned back to standard care for their condition. The patient will be monitored closely over the coming weeks to ensure a smooth transition and to address any residual effects of the investigational drug.

-------------- PATIENT ID 34 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On April 18th, 2021, I had the pleasure of conducting a clinic visit with Patient ID 34, an 80-year-old female who has been grappling with depression, schizophrenia, hypertension, and temporal lobe epilepsy for quite some time now. As per her medical history, the patient has experienced 22.0 seizures over the past two months alone, a concerning trend that warranted further evaluation and management.

Upon entering the examination room, I was struck by the patient's frail appearance and soft-spoken demeanor. Her speech was clear and concise, but her voice lacked the vigor and confidence one would expect from someone of her age and background. As I began my examination, I noticed that the patient had difficulty maintaining eye contact, often looking down or away when engaged in conversation. This could be attributed to her history of schizophrenia and depression, which can manifest in social anxiety and decreased self-esteem.

As part of the neurological examination, I conducted a thorough inspection of the patient's head and neck, paying close attention to any abnormalities or asymmetries. Her cranial nerves were intact, with no signs of weakness or paresis. The patient's tone was normal, with no evidence of rigidity or spasticity. I also conducted a series of cognitive tests to assess her memory, attention, and executive function, which revealed a few areas of concern that will need to be monitored closely over the coming weeks and months.

In light of the patient's history and recent seizure activity, I have decided to add the investigational drug for epilepsy to her treatment plan for the next three months. This decision was made after careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits, as well as consultation with the patient's primary care physician and specialist colleagues. As part of this trial, I will closely monitor the patient's seizure activity, cognitive function, and overall well-being to assess the efficacy and safety of the investigational drug. No changes will be made to her existing medications at this time, except for the addition of the new drug as mentioned above. The patient was informed of the rationale behind this decision, and she expressed her willingness to participate in the trial and adhere to the prescribed treatment regimen.

* Reflexes: Normal, with no signs of hyperexcitability or diminished reflexes.

Gait Examination:

The patient ambulates independently and without assistance. His gait is normal, with no signs of ataxia or weakness observed.

Assessment:

Based on the patient's history and neurological examination, he is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and parietal lobe epilepsy. He is currently experiencing an increase in seizure frequency, which may be related to the randomized controlled trial medication. The patient will continue his current medications and add the investigational drug for epilepsy for 3 months. Close monitoring of seizure frequency and severity will be necessary to assess the effectiveness of the new medication.

Plan:

1. Continue current medications (lamotrigine, valproate, and levetiracetam) as prescribed.
2. Add investigational drug for epilepsy for 3 months.
3. Monitor seizure frequency and severity closely over the next 3 months to assess the effectiveness of the new medication.
4. Follow up with the patient in 1 month to assess his progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
5. Encourage the patient to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, avoid alcohol and drugs, and engage in regular physical activity to reduce stress and promote overall health.

Clinic Note #2 - Patient ID 39 (87 year old female) - 2021-11-01

Identification:
Patient ID 39, an 87-year-old female, is a participant in a randomized controlled trial investigating the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug ID X93461 for the treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presents with a history of temporal lobe epilepsy, which has been well-controlled with levetiracetam and lamotrigine for the past several years. However, over the past 3 months, the patient has experienced an increase in seizure activity, with 18.0 seizures during this time period. The patient reports feeling fatigued and experiencing balance disorders.

Subjective:
During today's visit, the patient reported feeling generally well, but noted ongoing fatigue and balance difficulties. She also reported difficulty sleeping due to increased seizure activity. The patient expressed concerns about the potential side effects of the investigational drug and its impact on her overall health.

Medications:
The patient has been taking levetiracetam 500mg twice daily and lamotrigine 200mg once daily for the past several years. In addition, the patient has been receiving the investigational drug ID X93461, which was initiated 3 months ago.

Allergies:
The patient has no known allergies to medications or other substances.

Social History:
The patient is a widow and lives alone. She reports a supportive social network, including her children and grandchildren, who assist with her daily needs. The patient enjoys reading and spending time with her family, but has had to limit these activities due to ongoing seizure activity.

Review of Systems:
The patient reported no significant changes in her medical history since her last visit. She continues to experience occasional muscle weakness and memory difficulties, which are consistent with her longstanding history of temporal lobe epilepsy. The patient denied any recent travel, illnesses, or injuries.

General Physical Examination:
Vital signs were within normal limits. The patient's neurological examination was significant for a slight decline in cognitive function, as evidenced by decreased attention and memory difficulties. There were no other abnormal findings.

Comprehensive Neurologic Exam:
The patient underwent a comprehensive neurologic exam, which included an evaluation of her sensory motor functions, balance, and coordination. The exam revealed mild cognitive decline, consistent with the patient's history of temporal lobe epilepsy. There were no other abnormal findings.

Labs:
The patient's recent laboratory results included:

* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 20mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.5mg/dL
* Glucose: 120mg/dL
* Cholesterol: 180mg/dL
* Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): 6.8%

Imaging:
The patient's recent imaging results included:

* Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain: no significant abnormalities were noted.
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain: no significant abnormalities were noted.

Assessment:
Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory and imaging results, it is my assessment that the patient is experiencing a slight decline in cognitive function and ongoing seizure activity, consistent with her history of temporal lobe epilepsy. The patient's recent increase in seizures may be related to the discontinuation of the investigational drug ID X93461, which was initiated 3 months ago.

Plan:
Given the patient's ongoing seizure activity and slight decline in cognitive function, it is my recommendation that the patient continue levetiracetam and lamotrigine as prescribed, with close monitoring of seizure activity and adjustments made as needed. The patient will be transitioned off of the investigational drug ID X93461, as the study has been completed. The patient will be scheduled for follow-up visits every 2 months to monitor her seizure activity and cognitive function.

The patient's reflexes were normal, with no signs of spasticity or hyperreflexia.

The patient's recent seizure activity was evaluated using the Patient-Generated Index (PGI), which revealed a total of 10.0 seizures over the past 3 months. The patient reported that these seizures were mild to moderate in intensity and did not require any medical interventions. The patient's neurological status was otherwise unchanged, with no evidence of progression or regression of her disease.

Plan:

Given the patient's history of temporal lobe epilepsy and the recent seizure activity, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive regular follow-up care in our clinic to monitor her condition and adjust her medications as needed. The investigational drug ID X93461 will be discontinued now that the study is complete. The patient will be advised to maintain a seizure diary to track any changes in her seizure activity and to report any adverse effects or concerns promptly.

Key Points:

* The patient has been taking the investigational drug ID X93461 for the past 3 months and has reported experiencing 10.0 seizures during this time.
* The patient has also reported dizziness and gait disturbance.
* Neurological examination revealed decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick over the left hemiparesis, consistent with her history of temporal lobe epilepsy.
* The patient's recent seizure activity was evaluated using the Patient-Generated Index (PGI), which revealed a total of 10.0 seizures over the past 3 months.
* The investigational drug ID X93461 will be discontinued now that the study is complete, and the patient will be advised to maintain a seizure diary to track any changes in her seizure activity.

-------------- PATIENT ID 53 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On July 21st, 2021, I conducted a clinic visit with Patient ID 53, a 93-year-old male who has been experiencing an increased frequency of seizures over the past two months. The patient has a history of alcoholism, hypothyroidism, and generalized epilepsy, which has been well-controlled on current medications. However, due to the recent escalation in seizure activity, the patient has been enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to investigate a new investigational drug for the treatment of epilepsy.

During the clinic visit, I conducted a thorough neurological examination to assess the patient's current condition and monitor any changes or progression of their disease. The patient's vital signs were within normal limits, with a temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and a heart rate of 70 beats per minute. The patient's mental status was clear, with no evidence of confusion or disorientation.

The patient reported a total of 78 seizures in the past two months, with an average frequency of approximately 3-4 seizures per week. The seizures have been primarily generalized tonic-clonic in nature, with some occasional partial seizures. The patient has experienced no significant changes in their sensory or motor function, but has reported increased fatigue and weakness due to the frequent seizure activity.

Given the patient's history of alcoholism, hypothyroidism, and generalized epilepsy, as well as the recent escalation in seizure activity, I have decided to maintain the current medication regimen with no changes other than adding the investigational drug for epilepsy. The patient will be instructed to take the investigational drug for a period of three months, and their response to the treatment will be closely monitored during follow-up visits.

Generalized Epilepsy with Ataxia

The patient, a 99-year-old female with a history of generalized epilepsy, presented for her second visit in the randomized controlled trial. Over the past three months, the patient has been administered the investigational drug ID X93461 for her epilepsy. During this time, she has experienced 6.0 seizures, with ataxia being reported as a side effect.

Neurological Examination:

Upon examination, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. Her mental status was clear, and she was able to communicate effectively. The patient's speech was slightly slurred, likely due to the ataxia. The patient's neck muscles were stable, and there was no evidence of weakness or paralysis. The patient's sensation was intact, and there were no signs of peripheral neuropathy.

The patient's cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which revealed a score of 28 out of 30, indicating near-normal cognitive function. The patient's memory was intact, and she was able to recall recent events without difficulty. The patient's language skills were also normal, with no evidence of aphasia or dysarthria.

The patient's motor function was evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which revealed a score of 2 out of 4, indicating mild ataxia. The patient had difficulty with gait and balance, and she experienced occasional tremors in her hands. However, there was no evidence of rigidity or bradykinesia.

The investigational drug ID X93461 will be discontinued now that the study is complete. The patient's seizure activity will continue to be monitored, and any changes in her condition will be documented accordingly. The patient will be followed up with regular visits to assess her condition and ensure that she remains stable.

Clinic Note - Visit #1

Patient ID: 70

Date: 2021-09-26

Chief Complaint:

The patient presents with a history of schizophrenia, diabetes, and generalized epilepsy. She has experienced 74 seizures in the past two months. She is currently participating in a randomized controlled trial and has been instructed not to make any changes to her medications unless explicitly authorized by the study team.

History of Present Illness:

The patient reports experiencing an increased frequency of seizures over the past two months, with an average of 3-4 seizures per week. She denies any recent changes in her symptoms or medications. She reports that her seizures have been well-controlled on her current regimen but has noticed some increase in the intensity of her seizures recently.

Past Medical History:

The patient has a history of schizophrenia, diabetes, and generalized epilepsy. She has been previously treated with a variety of medications for these conditions, including antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and insulin therapy.

Medication List:

The patient is currently taking the following medications:

1. Risperidone (Risperdal) 2mg oral daily
2. Lamotrigine (Lamictal) 50mg oral daily
3. Levetiracetam (Keppra) 2000mg oral daily
4. Metformin (Glucophage) 1000mg oral daily
5. Insulin glargine (Lantus) 10 units subcutaneous daily

Review of Systems:

The patient denies any recent changes in her symptoms or medical history. She reports that she has been experiencing some increased fatigue and weight gain over the past few months, but these symptoms have been stable and do not seem to be related to her seizure activity.

Neurological Examination:

The patient's neurological examination was unremarkable, with no evidence of focal deficits or abnormal reflexes. Her speech is clear and coherent, and her language is intact. She does not exhibit any signs of dysarthria or aphasia. Her cranial nerves are normal, and she has no signs of facial weakness or paresis. Her coordination and balance are also normal, and she does not exhibit any signs of ataxia or tremors.

Assessment and Plan:

Based on the patient's history and examination, it is my assessment that the patient is experiencing an increased frequency of seizures likely related to her generalized epilepsy. The recent addition of the investigational drug for epilepsy may be contributing to this increase in seizure activity. I recommend that the patient continue her current medication regimen, with the addition of the investigational drug for the next three months as part of the randomized controlled trial. I also recommend that the patient return for regular follow-up visits to monitor her seizure activity and adjust her medications as needed.

Plan:

1. Continue current medication regimen, including risperidone, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, metformin, and insulin glargine.
2. Add investigational drug for epilepsy for the next three months as part of the randomized controlled trial.
3. Schedule regular follow-up visits every two weeks to monitor seizure activity and adjust medications as needed.
4. Instruct the patient not to make any changes to her medications unless explicitly authorized by the study team.

On October 26th, 2021, I conducted a clinic visit with Patient ID 70, a 38-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, diabetes, and generalized epilepsy. The patient has been participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and has been receiving the investigational drug ID X93461 for the past three months to treat her epilepsy.

According to the patient's report, she has experienced 25.0 seizures during this time period, which is a significant improvement compared to her previous baseline. However, the patient has also reported experiencing somnolence, which may be related to the medication. The patient's neurological examination revealed no changes in her cognitive function or motor skills, but she did exhibit mild tremors and rigidity, which are consistent with her pre-existing condition of generalized epilepsy.

Given that the RCT has now been completed, the investigational drug ID X93461 will be discontinued. The patient will be transitioned back to her standard of care medication and will be closely monitored for any changes in her seizure frequency or severity. It is important to note that the patient's somnolence may be a side effect of the investigational drug, but it could also be a symptom of another underlying condition. Therefore, close monitoring and regular follow-up appointments will be crucial in managing her condition effectively.

In conclusion, this clinic visit provided an opportunity to assess the patient's response to the investigational drug ID X93461 and to monitor her overall health. While the medication has shown some efficacy in reducing seizure frequency, it has also been associated with somnolence. As the RCT comes to an end, it is important to carefully transition the patient back to her standard of care medication and to continue monitoring her closely for any changes in her condition.

-------------- PATIENT ID 77 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On January 5th, 2022, I had the pleasure of conducting a clinic visit with Patient ID 77, a 91-year-old male who has been experiencing an increased frequency of seizures over the past two months. As part of a randomized controlled trial, the patient will be taking an investigational drug for the next three months to assess its effectiveness in managing their multifocal epilepsy.

Upon entering the examination room, I was greeted by the patient who appeared alert and in no apparent distress. After introducing myself and the purpose of my visit, I began the neurological examination. The patient's mentation was clear and focused, with no evidence of clouding or confusion. Their speech was normal in rate and rhythm, with no observable tremors or abnormalities.

The patient's cranial nerves were intact, with no signs of deficits or weaknesses. Their extraocular movements were smooth and coordinated, and their pupillary responses were normal. The patient's motor function was assessed through a series of gross motor movements, including flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and rotation. There were no observable deficits or weaknesses in any of these areas.

The patient's sensory examination revealed intact pinprick and light touch sensation over all areas of the body. However, there was a noticeable decrease in vibratory sensation in the lower extremities, consistent with their long-standing history of diabetes. The patient's reflexes were symmetrical and normal in amplitude, with no signs of hyporeflexia or hyperreflexia.

In conclusion, the neurological examination conducted on January 5th, 2022, revealed no significant changes or abnormalities in Patient ID 77's condition. The patient's cognitive function remains intact, and their motor and sensory functions are stable. As part of the randomized controlled trial, the patient will be taking the investigational drug for the next three months to assess its effectiveness in managing their multifocal epilepsy. Regular follow-up appointments have been scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and adjust medications as needed.

On March 3rd, 2022, Patient ID 78, a 64-year-old female, presented to our clinic for her first visit. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, depression, asthma, and epilepsy, with a recent increase in seizure activity. Over the past two months, the patient has experienced 59.0 seizures, which is concerning and warranted further evaluation.

During the clinical examination, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. She appeared alert and oriented, with no significant changes in her mental status or behavior. The patient's speech was clear and coherent, with no evidence of aphasia or dysarthria. Her motor function was intact, with no noticeable weakness, tremors, or ataxia. The patient's reflexes were normal, and she had no sensory deficits.

The patient's neurological examination revealed no significant abnormalities, other than a mild tremor in her hands, which is consistent with her history of hypothyroidism. Her cognitive function was intact, with no evidence of decline or impairment. The patient's recent seizure activity was carefully evaluated, and no new or unusual symptoms were noted.

Given the patient's history of epilepsy and recent increase in seizure activity, we have decided to enroll her in a randomized controlled trial investigating a new medication for the treatment of epilepsy.

-------------- PATIENT ID 99 -- VISIT 2 -----------

On March 23rd, 2023, I evaluated Patient ID 99, a 76-year-old male with a history of parietal lobe epilepsy, during visit #2 of our randomized controlled trial. Over the past three months, the patient has taken the investigational drug ID X93461 for his epilepsy and has experienced 33.0 seizures during this time. The patient has also reported constipation and diplopia as adverse effects of the medication.

Upon examination, the patient's neurological status was as follows: His speech was clear and coherent, with no evidence of aphasia or dysarthria. His motor function was intact, with no signs of weakness or paralysis. His sensory function was normal, with no deficits in vision, hearing, or somatosensation. His reflexes were normal and there was no evidence of ataxia or dyskinesia. His cranial nerve examination revealed no abnormalities, including no evidence of diplopia.

During the study, the patient experienced 33 seizures, which is a significant increase from his baseline rate. This finding suggests that the investigational drug ID X93461 may not be effective in controlling the patient's epilepsy. In light of this result, we have decided to discontinue the medication now that the study is complete. The patient will be transitioned back to his previous medication and will be monitored closely for any changes in his seizure activity.

In conclusion, visit #2 of our randomized controlled trial has provided valuable information about the effectiveness and safety of the investigational drug ID X93461 for the treatment of parietal lobe epilepsy. Although the medication showed promise in controlling the patient's seizures, the adverse effects of constipation and diplopia were significant. Based on these findings, we have decided to discontinue the medication and transition the patient back to his previous therapy. Further analysis of the data will be necessary to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of this medication for this indication.

-------------- PATIENT ID 119 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On July 25th, 2021, I conducted a clinic visit with Patient ID 119, a 71-year-old female with a history of asthma, depression, and parietal lobe epilepsy. The patient had been experiencing an increase in seizure activity over the past two months, with 16.0 seizures reported during this time frame. As part of a randomized controlled trial, the patient will be receiving an investigational drug for the treatment of her epilepsy, and no changes to her current medications will be made other than adding this new medication for a period of three months.

Upon examination, the patient's neurological status was as follows: Her general appearance was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her speech was clear and concise, with no noticeable tremors or dysarthria. The patient's motor function was intact, with no visible weakness, ataxia, or abnormal reflexes. Her sensory function was grossly normal, with no reported numbness or tingling in her extremities. The patient's cognitive status was normal, with no signs of confusion or disorientation.

The patient's seizure activity has been well-documented over the past two months, with 16.0 seizures reported during this time frame. These seizures have been characterized as simple partial seizures, with the patient experiencing a brief loss of awareness and staring spells, followed by a gradual return to baseline. The patient has also experienced some postictal confusion and disorientation, but these symptoms have been mild and transient.

In light of the patient's history of parietal lobe epilepsy and recent increase in seizure activity, I have recommended that she participate in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug for the treatment of her epilepsy. As part of this trial, the patient will be receiving the investigational drug for a period of three months, during which time her seizure activity will be closely monitored and documented. No changes to her current medications will be made other than adding the investigational drug, as we seek to maintain a stable therapeutic regimen while also assessing the potential benefits of this new treatment approach.

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a history of generalized epilepsy and has been participating in a randomized controlled trial for the investigational drug ID X93461.

History of Present Illness: The patient has been taking the investigational drug for the past three months and has reported complete seizure control during this time, with zero seizures recorded. However, she has recently noticed diplopia, which is a new symptom since starting the medication.

Past Medical History: The patient has a history of generalized epilepsy, with previous episodes of tonic-clonic seizures and absence seizures. She has tried various anticonvulsant medications in the past, including levetiracetam and sodium valproate, but has not achieved complete seizure control with these drugs.

Current Medications: The patient has been taking the investigational drug ID X93461 for the past three months, as part of the randomized controlled trial. She has also been taking leviteracetam and sodium valproate as previously prescribed medications.

Social History: The patient is a 22-year-old female who works as a freelance graphic designer. She reports that her seizures have significantly impacted her daily activities, including her ability to work and drive.

Family History: The patient's mother and grandmother both had a history of epilepsy, suggesting a possible genetic component to her condition.

Review of Systems: The patient reports no other symptoms or concerns besides the diplopia she has experienced since starting the investigational drug. She denies any changes in her vision, headaches, or fatigue.

General Observations: The patient appears well-oriented and alert, with normal speech and cognitive function. Her vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and a pulse rate of 70 beats per minute.

Neurological Examination: The patient's neurological examination reveals no signs of focal deficits or abnormalities in her sensory systems. Her visual acuity is within normal limits, with no evidence of diplopia or other visual disturbances. Her cranial nerves are intact, with no signs of weakness or paresis. Her muscle strength and tone are normal, with no evidence of ataxia or other motor abnormalities. Her reflexes are brisk and normal, without any signs of hyperexcitability or other abnormalities.

Assessment: Based on the patient's history and current symptoms, it is likely that the diplopia she has experienced since starting the investigational drug ID X93461 is related to the medication. As the study is complete, the investigational drug will be discontinued, and the patient will be transitioned back to her previous medications. The patient's seizure control remains a concern, and it may be necessary to consider alternative medications or treatment strategies to achieve better seizure control.

Plan:

1. Discontinue the investigational drug ID X93461, as the study is complete.

Patient ID: 150, Date of Visit: November 2, 2021

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a history of ADHD, dermatitis, depression, and occipital lobe epilepsy. He has experienced 11 seizures over the past two months.

History of Present Illness: The patient was recently enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of an investigational drug for the treatment of occipital lobe epilepsy. No changes have been made to the patient's medication regimen other than the addition of the investigational drug, which will be taken for a period of three months.

Neurological Examination: On examination, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. His cognitive function was intact, and he did not demonstrate any evidence of focal weakness or sensory deficits. His cranial nerves were grossly normal, with no evidence of abnormalities in eye movements, facial expressions, or tongue movements. His motor function was intact, without any evidence of weakness, ataxia, or tremors. His reflexes were normal, and his coordination and balance were also within normal limits.

The patient's neurological examination did reveal some abnormalities in his dermatological status, with the presence of several patches of eczema on his arms, legs, and back. These patches were not particularly tender or inflamed, but they did appear to be causing some discomfort for the patient.

Assessment and Plan: Based on the patient's history and neurological examination, it is clear that he is experiencing a significant number of seizures, which is a major concern for his overall health and quality of life. The addition of the investigational drug to his medication regimen may help to reduce the frequency and severity of these seizures, but this will need to be carefully monitored over the coming months. In addition to the ongoing clinical trial, the patient's dermatological status will also need to be closely managed to prevent any further discomfort or complications. Regular follow-up appointments will be necessary to assess the patient's progress and make any necessary adjustments to his treatment regimen.

Clinic Note Visit #2 - 2022-06-19

Patient ID: 151
Age: 89 years old (Female)

The patient, a 89-year-old female with a history of autism, dermatitis, hypothyroidism, and epilepsy, was seen in the clinic on 2022-06-19 for visit #2. The patient has been participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and has been taking the investigational drug ID X93461 for the past three months. During this time, the patient has experienced 65 seizures, which is a significant increase from her previous baseline.

On examination, the patient presented with several new symptoms, including dizziness, nystagmus, diplopia, and gait disturbance. These symptoms are likely related to the investigational drug, as they have developed since she began taking it. The patient's neurological examination revealed no significant changes in her motor function or cognitive status, but there was a noticeable decline in her balance and coordination.

Given the high frequency of seizures and the new symptoms that have developed, it has been decided to discontinue the investigational drug ID X93461. The study is now complete, and the patient will be transitioned back to her previous medications for epilepsy management. It is important to closely monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust her treatment plan as needed to ensure her safety and well-being.

In conclusion, this clinic note highlights the importance of careful monitoring in clinical trials, particularly when working with older adult patients who may be more susceptible to adverse effects. The development of new symptoms and the high frequency of seizures in this patient underscore the need for vigilant observation and prompt intervention when necessary.

-------------- PATIENT ID 159 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On October 19th, 2021, Patient ID 159, a 91-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and temporal lobe epilepsy, presented for a clinic visit. The patient has experienced an alarming increase in seizure activity over the past two months, with a total of 58 seizures reported. This is a significant worsening from the patient's previous baseline, which was already quite high due to their history of alcoholism and temporal lobe epilepsy.

During the clinic visit, a comprehensive neurological examination was performed, including an assessment of the patient's cognitive function, balance and coordination, and sensory processing. The results of this examination revealed several notable findings. Firstly, the patient's cognitive function was found to be relatively intact, with only minor decline in their memory and executive functioning abilities. Secondly, the patient's balance and coordination were found to be significantly impaired, likely due to the effects of aging and the seizure activity. Lastly, the patient's sensory processing was found to be within normal limits.

Given the patient's history of alcoholism and temporal lobe epilepsy, it is not surprising that they have experienced such a large increase in seizure activity over the past two months. However, the fact that the patient is participating in a randomized controlled trial suggests that they are receiving active treatment for their condition, which may help to explain the observed improvement in their cognitive function and sensory processing. Additionally, the addition of the investigational drug for epilepsy will likely provide further benefit to the patient's seizure control, given its known efficacy in treating temporal lobe epilepsy.

Overall, the clinic visit on October 19th, 2021, provided valuable insights into Patient ID 159's ongoing health status and revealed several notable findings related to their cognitive function, balance and coordination, and sensory processing. These findings will be carefully considered in the development of an appropriate treatment plan for the patient moving forward.

* Motor function: The patient exhibits mild weakness in his left arm and leg, which may be related to the temporal lobe epilepsy.
* Sensory function: The patient demonstrates normal sensation in all areas, with no notable deficits or abnormalities.

LABS:

The following laboratory tests were performed:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): Within normal limits
* Electrolyte Panel: Within normal limits
* Liver Function Tests (LFTs): Within normal limits
* Renal Function Tests (RFTs): Within normal limits

IMAGING:

The following imaging studies were performed:

* Computed Tomography (CT) Scan of the Head: No significant abnormalities were detected.
* Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain: No significant abnormalities were detected.

ASSESSMENT:

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory and imaging findings, it is assessed that the patient is experiencing increased frequency of seizures due to the temporal lobe epilepsy. The investigational drug being used in the RCT may be contributing to the increased frequency of seizures, but this cannot be definitively determined at this time. The patient's cognitive function and memory appear to be mildly affected, which may be related to the seizures or the investigational drug.

PLAN:

The patient will continue to participate in the RCT and receive the investigational drug for the next 3 months. No changes will be made to his current medications, other than adding the investigational drug. The patient will be closely monitored for any changes in seizure frequency or severity, as well as for any potential adverse effects of the investigational drug.

Clinic Note - Visit #2 (2023-01-20) for Patient ID 173, 95 year old male with history of parietal lobe epilepsy.

Today, I had the pleasure of examining Patient ID 173, a 95-year-old male who has been participating in a randomized controlled trial for the investigational drug ID X93461 for his parietal lobe epilepsy. Over the past three months, the patient has been taking this medication and has reported experiencing 18 seizures during this time. Additionally, the patient has reported feeling dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue since starting the medication.

On examination, the patient's neurological status was as follows: The patient's speech was clear and coherent, and his thought processes were logical and goal-directed. His motor function was intact, with no noticeable weakness or paresis. However, the patient did exhibit a mild dysmetria on the right side of his body, which is likely related to the seizures he has experienced. The patient's reflexes were normal, and his sensation was intact.

Given the patient's history of parietal lobe epilepsy and the significant number of seizures he has experienced while taking the investigational drug ID X93461, it is my recommendation that the medication be discontinued at this time. While the drug has shown promise in reducing seizure frequency, the potential risks associated with its use, including dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue, outweigh any potential benefits for this patient.

In conclusion, today's examination revealed a mild dysmetria on the right side of the patient's body, likely related to the seizures he has experienced while taking the investigational drug ID X93461. The medication will be discontinued given the patient's history of parietal lobe epilepsy and the significant number of seizures he has experienced while taking the drug. Further monitoring and management of the patient's condition will be necessary to ensure his continued health and well-being.

Clinic Note #1

Date: 2022-02-15
Patient ID: 177

Identification:
Name: Mary Johnson
Age: 90 years old
Gender: Female

Chief Complaint: Mary presents with a history of alcoholism and occipital lobe epilepsy, with a recent increase in seizure frequency.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Mary has been experiencing an increased frequency of seizures over the past two months, with 9 episodes reported since January 2022. These seizures have been characterized as occipital lobe epilepsy, with Mary describing a sensation of "seeing stars" followed by loss of consciousness. She has also noted some confusion and disorientation following the seizures.

Subjective:
Mary reports no changes in her medications since her last clinic visit, although she has been adherent to her prescribed regimen. She denies any recent alcohol consumption. Mary expresses concern about the recent increase in seizures and its potential impact on her cognitive function.

Objective:
Mary's vital signs are within normal limits. Her neurological examination reveals no significant abnormalities, with the exception of a mild tremor in her hands. The remainder of her physical examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory Findings:
Mary's complete blood count (CBC) and electrolyte panels are within normal limits. Her serum alcohol level is undetectable, indicating that she has not consumed alcohol recently.

Imaging Findings:
Recent MRI scans of Mary's brain reveal no significant abnormalities or changes since her last scan.

Assessment:
Given Mary's history of occipital lobe epilepsy and recent increase in seizure frequency, it is possible that the investigational drug being used in the randomized controlled trial may be contributing to this change. However, without any changes in her medications, it is also possible that other factors may be contributing to the increased seizure activity. The mild tremor observed in Mary's hands may be a sign of underlying parkinsonism or other extrapyramidal disorders. Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine the cause of Mary's seizures and to assess the efficacy of the investigational drug.

Plan:

1. Continue with current medications, including the investigational drug, for a period of 3 months.
2. Monitor Mary's seizure activity closely, with follow-up visits scheduled every 2 weeks.
3. Evaluate Mary's cognitive function and potential alcohol withdrawal symptoms during each follow-up visit.

Clinic Note #1 (2023-02-10)

Patient ID: 211

Age: 87 years old

Gender: Male

Chief Complaint: Generalized epilepsy with 22 seizures in the past 2 months.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient presents with a history of generalized epilepsy, which has been poorly controlled over the past two months. He has experienced 22 seizures during this time, with no significant changes in his medication regimen. The patient is currently enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug for epilepsy.

Subjective:

The patient reports experiencing frequent seizures over the past two months, with no significant improvements in his symptoms despite continued treatment with standard anticonvulsant medications. He has noticed some improvement in his condition since enrolling in the RCT, but notes that his seizures have not been fully controlled. The patient also reports experiencing some cognitive difficulties, including memory loss and confusion, which he attributes to the seizures.

Objective:

On examination, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. His general physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities. However, a comprehensive neurological examination reveals the following findings:

* Cranial nerve examination: The patient's pupils are equal and reactive to light, with no signs of afferent pupillary defect. His extraocular movements are full and without abnormalities. His facial expressions are normal, with no signs of weakness or paresis.
* Motor examination: The patient's muscle strength is normal, with no signs of atrophy or weakness. His tone is slightly increased, particularly in his upper limbs. His reflexes are normal, with no signs of hyporeflexia or hyperreflexia.
* Sensory examination: The patient's sensation is intact, with no signs of numbness or paresthesias. His proprioception and coordination are normal, with no signs of ataxia or dysmetria.
* Cerebellar function examination: The patient's cerebellar functions are within normal limits, with no signs of ataxia or dysmetria.

Laboratory Findings:

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): White blood cell count (WBC) 4.8 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin (Hb) 13.2 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) 40.5%, platelet count (Plt) 400 x 10^9/L.
* Electrolytes: Sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 24 mmol/L.
* Renal Function Tests: Creatinine 0.87 mg/dL, urea 24 mg/dL.
* Liver Function Tests: Aspartate transaminase (AST) 19 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 22 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 13 U/L, albumin 4.2 mg/dL.

Imaging Findings:

The patient's imaging results are as follows:

* Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain: No significant abnormalities were noted.
* Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain: No significant abnormalities were noted.

Assessment:

The patient's history of poorly controlled generalized epilepsy, coupled with his recent experience of 22 seizures in the past two months, suggests a complex and refractory condition. The patient's participation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating an investigational drug for epilepsy is a significant factor in his current management. Given the patient's history of poor medication adherence and the lack of significant improvements in his symptoms despite continued treatment with standard anticonvulsant medications, it is likely that the patient's seizures are not fully controlled by these medications.

Plan:

1. Continue the patient's current medication regimen, including his standard anticonvulsant medications and the investigational drug being tested in the RCT.
2. Monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust his medication regimen as needed to achieve better seizure control.
3. Recommend close follow-up with the study team to ensure compliance with the RCT protocol and to monitor the patient's response to the investigational drug.
4. Consider other treatment options, such as surgical interventions or alternative medications, if the patient's seizures remain poorly controlled despite continued treatment with standard anticonvulsant medications and the investigational drug.

Patient ID 230, a 97-year-old female, was seen in clinic on January 5, 2022 for her second visit. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, arthritis, bipolar disorder, and occipital lobe epilepsy. She has been participating in a randomized controlled trial and has been receiving the investigational drug ID X93461 for the past three months to treat her epilepsy.

During this visit, the patient reported experiencing balance disorders, headaches, and decreased appetite over the past few months. The patient also mentioned that she had experienced five seizures since starting the investigational drug. These symptoms are concerning and may be related to the medication. A complete neurological examination was performed, including an assessment of the patient's balance, coordination, and reflexes. Additionally, the patient's cognitive function, memory, and mood were evaluated.

The results of the neurological examination revealed some concerning findings. The patient had difficulty with balance and coordination, and her reflexes were decreased. Her cognitive function was also affected, as she had difficulty recalling recent events and exhibited poor judgment. Furthermore, the patient reported feeling tired and lethargic, which may be related to the medication.

Based on the results of the neurological examination and the patient's symptoms, it is recommended that the investigational drug ID X93461 be discontinued. The patient will be transitioned back to her previous medications, including levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for arthritis. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's condition and address any concerns or symptoms that may arise in the future.

On March 5th, 2021, I had the pleasure of conducting a clinic visit with Patient ID 231, a 32-year-old female who presented with a history of occipital lobe epilepsy. The patient has experienced an alarming increase in seizure frequency over the past two months, with a total of 11 seizures during this timeframe. Given the patient's medical background and current symptoms, it was decided that she would participate in a randomized controlled trial aimed at exploring the efficacy of an investigational drug for epilepsy.

During the clinic visit, I conducted a thorough neurological examination to assess the patient's overall condition and identify any potential triggers or contributing factors to her seizures. The examination revealed no notable abnormalities in the patient's cognitive function, balance, or reflexes. However, I did observe some subtle changes in the patient's speech patterns and eye movements, which may indicate a mild degree of dysfunction in the patient's temporal lobe.

In light of these findings, it is essential that we continue to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed. The patient has been prescribed an investigational drug for epilepsy, which she will be taking for a period of three months. During this time, it will be crucial to track the patient's seizure frequency and assess the efficacy of the new medication. Additionally, I have advised the patient to maintain a detailed seizure journal to help us better understand the timing and severity of her seizures.

In conclusion, clinic visit #1 with Patient ID 231 was an opportunity for us to assess the patient's current condition and outline a plan for managing her epilepsy moving forward. While some subtle changes in the patient's speech patterns and eye movements were observed, it is essential that we continue to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed. With the patient participating in a randomized controlled trial and taking an investigational drug for epilepsy, we are optimistic about improving her seizure frequency and overall quality of life.

* Electrolyte Panel: Within normal limits
* Lipid Panel: Within normal limits
* Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH): Within normal limits

Imaging:

* MRI Brain: No evidence of structural abnormalities or lesions.

Assessment:

Ms. Smith presents with a history of parietal lobe epilepsy and recent increases in seizure frequency, which is concerning for potential medication non-adherence or progression of her disease. Her cognitive function and motor function are within normal limits, but she does report difficulty with memory and concentration, as well as recent changes in her mood.

Plan:

1. Continue current medications (levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and valproate) and monitor for any changes in seizure frequency or severity.
2. Add the investigational drug (I.D.) to Ms. Smith's regimen for the next three months, with close monitoring of her clinical status and laboratory results.
3. Repeat MRI Brain in three months to assess for any changes in her brain structure or function.
4. Encourage Ms. Smith to maintain a detailed seizure log to monitor for any changes in her seizure activity.
5. Schedule follow-up appointments every three months to assess her clinical status and make any necessary adjustments to her medication regimen.

-------------- PATIENT ID 239 -- VISIT 1 -----------

On August 29th, 2021, Patient ID 239, a 49-year-old female, presented to our clinic for her first visit. The patient has a history of seasonal allergies, ADHD, and epilepsy. She has experienced seven seizures in the past two months, which is a significant increase from her usual frequency. As part of her treatment plan, the patient is currently participating in a randomized controlled trial, and no changes to her medications will be made at this time beyond adding the investigational drug for epilepsy that she will take for three months.

During the neurological examination, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. Her consciousness was clear, and her speech was coherent and appropriate to her level of education. The patient's memory was intact, and she was able to perform simple calculations accurately. The patient's sensory motor function was mostly intact, with some mild weakness in the left arm and leg. Her coordination and balance were also normal.

The patient's reflexes were normal, and there was no evidence of any abnormal movements or tremors. Her cranial nerves were intact, with no signs of dysfunction. The patient's funduscopic examination revealed a normal optic disc and macula. The rest of her neurological examination was unremarkable, including her mental status, language, and executive function.

Based on the patient's history and examination findings, it is apparent that her recent increase in seizures is a significant concern. However, as part of the randomized controlled trial, no changes to her medications will be made at this time beyond adding the investigational drug for epilepsy. We will closely monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust her treatment plan as needed. The patient will follow up with us in one month for a subsequent visit.
